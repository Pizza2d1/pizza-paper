# pizza-paper
A wallpaper switching bash script that I made to try and learn some bash (because I think Ill use it in future careers) and because I wanted it to be customizable to me, I use linux btw

#How to use
All functionality can be done with pizza-paper.sh and does not require any additional packages to be downloaded (I don't think)
If you are in a weird version of linux (looking at you Ethan) you may need to install something from this list: [zenity, eog, gsettings]

#Make sure you are not running it as root (sudo)
Unless you want to use path-adder.sh (which is completely optional)
