# pizza-paper ver 1.2.7 stable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on
___
Most likely the last version that I work on unless I care enough

# pizza-paper version 1.1.4
>>>>>>> bc92391 (Update README.md)
A wallpaper switching bash script that I made to try and learn some bash (because I think Ill use it in future careers) and because I wanted it to be customizable to me, I use linux btw

# How to use
All functionality can be done with pizza-paper.sh and does not require any additional packages to be downloaded (I don't think)
If you are in a weird version of linux (looking at you Ethan) you may need to install something from this list: [zenity, gsettings]
Right now it only works for gnome versions of linux, to find out if yours is gnome, run "echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" in terminal

# Make sure you are not running it as root (sudo)
Unless you want to use path-adder.sh (which is completely optional)
