# pizza-paper ver 1.2.7 stable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on
___
Most likely the last version that I work on unless I care enough

# How to use
You run _~/pizza-paper.sh_

All functionality can be done with pizza-paper.sh and does not require any additional packages to be downloaded (I don't think)

If you are in a non-ubuntu version of linux you may need to install packages from this list: [feh, zenity, gsettings]

Right now it only works for gnome versions of linux, to find out if yours is gnome, run "echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" in terminal

# Make sure you are not running it as root (sudo)
Unless you want to use path-adder.sh, which is completely optional for small QOL changes

# Will add these necessary directories and files needed to run
(These will NOT delete your current directory files if you already have these directories, don't worry)
