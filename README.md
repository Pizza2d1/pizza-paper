# pizza-paper ver 1.2.1 unstable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on

# WIP:
Adding settings function, implementing better gui for adding and selecting custom wallpapers, debugging file location issues

Feelin cute, might rewrite 40% of code to make it look pretty

Just finishing polishing up the code to prevent errors with any combination
