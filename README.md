___
Most likely the last version that I work on unless I care enough

>>>>>>> 4cfdfac (Final update)
A wallpaper switching bash script that I made to try and learn some bash (because I think Ill use it in future careers) and because I wanted it to be customizable to me, I use linux btw

# How to use
You run _~/pizza-paper.sh_

All functionality can be done with pizza-paper.sh and does not require any additional packages to be downloaded (I don't think)

If you are in a non-ubuntu version of linux you may need to install packages from this list: [feh, zenity, gsettings]

Right now it only works for gnome versions of linux, to find out if yours is gnome, run "echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" in terminal

# Make sure you are not running it as root (sudo)
