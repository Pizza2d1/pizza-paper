# pizza-paper ver 1.1.5 unstable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on

Current Features That Are Being Worked On:
Letting the user download 4 sample wallpapers to use with the program, along with letting to user add wallpapers from URL links
