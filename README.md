# pizza-paper ver 1.2.4 unstable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on

# WIP:
Polishing code to eventually port to main branch, removing unneccessary code, making sure inputs work as they should.

Preventing wallpaper from dissapearing when deleting the image file linked to it by automatically setting it back to a default wallpaper
