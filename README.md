# pizza-paper ver 1.1.5 unstable
The usually unstable version of pizza-paper that I keep here in case I want to work on it somewhere else or I accidentally delete the main files that I've been working on

# WIP:
(DONE) Letting the user download 4 sample wallpapers to use with the program, along with letting to user add wallpapers from URL links

Just finishing polishing up the code to prevent errors with any combination
